# KCIT

You crashed onto an unknown planet only to find out that it brought you forward into the future. In this realm, you are met with brain-eating zombies that constantly hunt you down. Lucky for you, the chests provide you with the resources to advance. However, your hunger seems to deplete by the tick of the clock. Yet, you discover that eating grants you a strength boost.

There is no slowing down. Craft, smelt, cook, eat, evade and SURVIVE. Traverse to other worlds by time-travelling back to the past, where you will also unlock items with special abilities. Amidst this chaos, you must make it back no matter what..
